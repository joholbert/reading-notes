## Growth Mindset
* A growth mindset is a type of mindset that a person is constantly developing
* This type of mindset can learn from school, first hand experiences, counselors, mentors, and from just about anyone or anything if a person deems it as efficient

## Reminders to Myself
* What have I done today to earn the lifestyle that I want to live?
* Never stop learning.
* Never stop improving things about yourself.
